Hello Jordie! 
I really appreciate how informative your website is! I actually didn't know most of the information on your website! 
Another thing I like about your page is how color coordinated your pages are. I really like the warm color scheme!

Some things I found that might help! 
1. I would try moving the image on your main page down lower or make it to the float left of some of your text. 
That way you can bring some more of the main content of the page a little higher up so there is less need to scroll.

Edit:           added text wrapping and a left image class to allow teh image to sit in between the rest of the text

2. On the art page, the background color of the box elements that your images are in, provide a good contrast that makes them stick out! 
Although I would try to use a different color that matches a little better with your warm color scheme that is prevalent on the rest of the website.
            
 Edit:            I changed this to 941F4E to match with the backgroud 


3. The last thing I would take a look into is your <h4>s on your art and history pages, I would look into making those a bit bigger. 
Maybe with an <h2> tag instead, that way the title of the page sticks out to the user a lot more.

Over all I really like your webpage! It is very informative and I love the color scheme you went with. 
Especially the gradient that you use in the background!

So already this is some of my jam. I really like Typefaces, even if I don't dig around in their history I am always on the lookout for a good typeface. 
Some of my favorite parts of any design task is finding the right typeface for the job and I can spend hours trying out various ones to see if they fit the job.
 We've got a gradient background which I love, I'm always down for things non-standard in modern web design and this color evokes a calm sunset and doesn't make the
  text in front of it too difficult to read. The breakpoints on the website form fit to whatever screensize I'm using too! It's great

 If I had any tips or suggestions, it would be to reduce the font size of the headers as the screen gets smaller (it's something I forgot to do as well!) and also, 
 though it hasn't been taught quite yet, using the Fraktur typeface on your website! You can, using CSS, 
 get the browser to use a typeface that is not standard installed on their computers :D 

for instance, my website is based on the video game Skyrim so I looked up what primary fonts skyrim used in it's design and found Futura. 
From there I put it in it's own special folder in my website, and then put this bit of code into my CSS:


@font-face {

    font-family: Futura;

    src: url('../fonts/futura.otf');

}

with this, the browser will utilize that typeface on the website, all without them having to go download and install it themselves. 
It's a really handy bit of code and I think your website would really benefit from utilizing this bit of css.
