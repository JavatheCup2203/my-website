    <!--General history-->

    <p>Fraktur was first created in the 16th century for a Triumphal Arch commissioned by Emperor Maximilian I.
        It was specifically designed for this woodcut art piece, but its distinctive style quickly gained
        popularity in German-speaking regions. Over time, Fraktur became the dominant script, replacing the
        previously used Schwabacher and Textualis typefaces.</p>

    <p>During this time, standard writing was highly valued. Monks, who were responsible for transcribing texts,
        used quills to carefully form each letter by hand. This challenge led to the rise of Fraktur, a script
        designed to simplify the writing process. Rounded letters, such as O’s and U’s, were particularly
        difficult to create with quills, so scribes developed a style that broke these shapes into a series of
        angular, fragmented lines. While one might expect Fraktur to have fallen out of use with the invention
        of the printing press and other advancements, it remained popular for centuries. However, much like
        cursive today, its use gradually declined over time. </p>

    <p>But as the story goes, near the end of the 16th century, Italian scholars began rediscovering and
        developing their own Roman typefaces from ancient texts. These typefaces quickly became the standard in
        countries like France and Spain, eventually spreading to the Netherlands and Sweden by the 18th century.
    </p>

    <p>Germany, however, remained loyal to its blackletter traditions, particularly Fraktur. But as the country
        unified and became more internationally engaged, a divide emerged over its use. Some saw Fraktur as an
        outdated relic of the Middle Ages, while others viewed abandoning it as a threat to national identity.
        As a result, Germany became typographically split—you could walk down a street and see signs written in
        Roman and on the same road Fraktur script on a different sign.</p>
    <p>In the end, Fraktur lost the battle of typefaces, and ironically, it was none other than Adolf Hitler who
        sealed its fate.</p>
