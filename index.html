    <p><span class="highlight">Why Fraktur began being less used</span></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Italians rediscovered Roman scripts, leading to the creation of Times New Roman.</li>
        <li>As Germany united and engaged internationally, Fraktur became difficult for others to read.</li>
        <li>Hitler himself opposed it, believing it kept Germany stuck in the past.</li>
    </ol>
<!-- Some slight context -->
    <p>Fraktur was once Germanys major dialect but because of historical events it fell out of style which is now causing many historical German artifacts increasinlg harder to read</p>
